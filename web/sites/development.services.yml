    # Twig debugging:
    #
    # When debugging is enabled:
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that
    #   contain theming information, such as template file name suggestions.
    # - Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    #   check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'debug'
    #   should be set to FALSE.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
    #
    # For more information about debugging Twig templates, see
    # https://www.drupal.org/node/1906392.

    # Twig auto-reload:
    #
    # Automatically recompile Twig templates whenever the source code changes.
    # If you don't provide a value for auto_reload, it will be determined
    # based on the value of debug.

    # Enabling auto-reload is not recommended in production environments.

    # Twig cache:
    #
    # By default, Twig templates will be compiled and stored in the filesystem
    # to increase performance. Disabling the Twig cache will recompile the
    # templates from source each time they are used. In most cases the
    # auto_reload setting above should be enabled rather than disabling the
    # Twig cache.
    #
    # Disabling the Twig cache is not recommended in production environments.

    # File extensions:
    #
    # List of file extensions the Twig system is allowed to load via the
    # twig.loader.filesystem service. Files with other extensions will not be
    # loaded unless they are added here. For example, to allow a file named
    # 'example.partial' to be loaded, add 'partial' to this list. To load files
    # with no extension, add an empty string '' to the list.
    #
    # @default ['css', 'html', 'js', 'svg', 'twig']
